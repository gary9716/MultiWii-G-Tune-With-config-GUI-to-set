# MultiWii-G-Tune-With-config-GUI-to-set
Original Work please refer to http://technicaladventure.blogspot.tw/2014/08/zeropid-tunes-for-multirotors-part2.html

The Only Thing I Do was adding a button to enable and disable G_Tune Mode on MultiWii Config GUI which could be downloaded from this repo
Good Luck!
